 Predicting the subscription in Bank Marketing Using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-Means Clustering

The "Bank Marketing" dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository consists of 41,188 instances, with each instance representing a unique visit to a banking website. The dataset contains 21 attributes, including 10 numerical values and 11 categorical features. The target variable (y) indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit, classified as either "yes" or "no".

The dataset requires some data preparation steps before applying machine learning techniques. There are no missing values in the dataset, eliminating the need for imputation or removal of incomplete instances. However, some categorical features may have unknown or unspecified categories, requiring handling during analysis.

Applied the Logistic Regression , SVM and K-means Clustering alogirthms to predict the target varaible. Predicted the y against all varibales in the scenario 1 and predicted tge y against selected features in the scenario 2 .

Logisitic Regression and SVM Model are predicting the target variable with the accuracy near to 90 % in the both the scenarios .

Based on the Results and outputs Job,Duration,Bank Rate , Consi index are important features which effecting the predicitng the outcome.
other than above Market Campaign and Season wise and customer wise offerings will give best outputs to the Bank.
